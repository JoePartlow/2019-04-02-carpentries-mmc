```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
d <- readr::read_csv(here("data/gapminder/raw/gapminder_data.csv"))
#names(d)

#plot(geom_line(x, y, alpha, color, linetype, size ))
#plot(geom_line(d.year, d.pop, alpha, color, linetype, size ))
ggplot(data=d, aes(x= year,y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap( ~ country)

```

The data consists of years from `r range(d$year)`.


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
